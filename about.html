    <h2>About the Project</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Academic Tracker</strong> is an all-in-one solution designed to simplify student academic management. 
      Built with the modern student in mind, it offers tools that let you monitor your attendance and calculate your CGPA effortlesslyâ€”all in one sleek, minimal interface.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Students often struggle to manually track attendance and CGPA across semesters.</li>
      <li>Institutions provide basic stats, but not personalized forecasting (like how many classes you can afford to miss).</li>
      <li>Thereâ€™s a lack of unified tools that combine both **attendance insights** and **grade analytics**.</li>
      <li>We wanted something intuitive, visually pleasing, and built by studentsâ€”for students.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
